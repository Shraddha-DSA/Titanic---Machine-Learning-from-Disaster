# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster
Model Used: Logistic Regression
Accuracy: ~84% on validation set
Preprocessing:
  Handled missing values for Age, Fare, and Embarked
  Converted Sex and Embarked to numerical values
  Dropped non-informative columns like Name, Cabin, Ticket
  Standard preprocessing applied to both train and test datasets

Note:
This is a baseline logistic regression model. Further improvements can be made using feature engineering (e.g., titles, family size) and advanced models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
